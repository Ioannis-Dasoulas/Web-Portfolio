                    currently working as a Computer Science PhD Researcher.
                    After graduating from University of Patras with an Integrated Master
                    in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a specialization in machine
                    learning, data science and software development, I started pursuing a
                    PhD in Computer Science at KU Leuven. My research work focuses on data
                    engineering for machine learning pipelines leveraging linked data and
                    software development for knowledge graph construction and data linking.
                    In my free time, I work on projects related to deep learning and cyber-physical
                    systems, as well as for the Beyond Orbit robotics team as a software engineer.  </p>

                        data-centric manner, with the goal of curating data from diverse machine learning publicly
                        available sources, examining machine-learning-related data and metadata from online repositories,

                        is used to estimate the distance between the rocks and the camera and then estimate the rock's size using
                         the dimensions of the bounding boxes. Code will soon be open-sourced.</p>

                        developed using Python programming language. In total, three different game models 
                        were created, a model that was trained by playing games against itself, a model that 
                        was trained with data from past professional games stored in online databases and a

                         to predict the value of houses. The prediction is accomplished using: a)
                         Least Mean Squares Linear Regression, b) Ordinary Least Squares Regression and c) Neural Network.
